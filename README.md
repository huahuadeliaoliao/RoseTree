# RST (RoseTree)

A fast and efficient command-line tool for scanning directories, analyzing file structures, and extracting file contents with support for `.gitignore` rules.

## Features

- 🚀 **Fast Performance**: Multi-threaded file scanning using Rayon
- 📁 **Smart File Detection**: Accurate UTF-8 text file detection using content inspection
- 🎯 **Selective Extraction**: Choose specific file types to include in the output
- 🔍 **GitIgnore Support**: Optionally apply `.gitignore` rules during scanning
- 📊 **Detailed Statistics**: Performance timing breakdown for all operations
- 🌳 **Tree Structure**: Generate beautiful directory tree visualization
- 📝 **Content Export**: Extract file contents to timestamped output files

## Installation

```bash
cargo install rosetree
```

### From Source (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huahuadeliaoliao/RoseTree.git
cd RoseTree
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Simply run the command in any directory:

```bash
rst
```

The tool will:

1. **Scan** the current directory and all subdirectories
2. **Detect** `.gitignore` files and ask if you want to apply the rules
3. **Analyze** all UTF-8 readable files and group them by extension
4. **Display** available file types for selection
5. **Extract** selected file contents to a timestamped output file

### Interactive Prompts

- **GitIgnore Rules**: Choose `y` to respect `.gitignore` files, `n` to scan all files
- **File Type Selection**: 
  - Enter specific numbers (e.g., `1 3 5`) to select certain file types
  - Enter `a` to select all file types

### Example Session

```
Scanning current directory and subdirectories...

Found the following .gitignore files:
  - .gitignore
  - frontend/.gitignore

Apply .gitignore rules? (y/n):
y

Found the following UTF-8 file types:
1. rs
2. md
3. toml
4. json
5. js

Enter file type numbers to extract (space-separated, 'a' for all types):
1 2 3

Reading file contents...

File contents successfully extracted to: rosetree_20240623_143022.txt
```

## Output Format

The generated file contains:

1. **File Structure**: A tree view of all scanned files
2. **File Contents**: Each file's content with clear separation and headers

Example output structure:
```

## Performance

RST is optimized for speed:

- **Parallel Processing**: Files are scanned and processed in parallel
- **Smart Sampling**: Only reads the first 1024 bytes for UTF-8 detection
- **Memory Efficient**: Streams file content instead of loading everything into memory
- **Timing Reports**: Built-in performance monitoring

Example timing output:
```
